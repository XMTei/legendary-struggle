The core gameplay loop is 1-2 minute fights with interesting mechanics:

- Boss phases (think MMORPG)
- Status Effects, skills that have bonus, etc
- Resistances
- A five part role system (Tank, DPS, Heal, Buff, Debuf)


Some progression ideas:

- Start solo in an arena
- Start gathering people to fight with in increasing difficulty fights
- Those other people (followers) would by default not allow any customization
- As rep increases, allow them to learn other "spec" loadouts for different roles
- Also improve equipment / select some talet tree like thing
- In "full" game you run an entire merc company as you prepare for a final fight
