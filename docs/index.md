Legendary Struggle, or LS for short until I come up with a better name, is a set of gaming ideas I've been kicking around for a long time.

## Overview

LS is a turn based combat game, think Final Fantasy before the Active Time Battle, where your party fights a number of lesser and boss encounters. In between combats, a deep trait and inventory customization system along with changing encounter details will hopefully be as interesting as the combat itself.

### Goals

- Bite sized "coffeebreak" gameplay - As a side project, there won't be enough content to match many games. Use roguelike "runs", unlocking additional classes, challenge modes, and all of the other tricks ot strech what we have.
- Snappy gameplay in combat while keeping depth - The standard five man party system involves a lot of button spamming even in trivial fights. Force the player to control only one character and use roles/orders/out of party customization to run other characters.
- Leverage limited art skills to stay on theme - 16 bit graphics are for sale and keeping the art simple will encourage deep gameplay (as many roguelikes show).
- Actually finish it - I've half-finished many games. Spec out 3 or 4 "phases" without being too aggressive on feature set. Save UI to the end, since that often bogs down things. Allows UI decision (SkiaSharp, Unity, something web like?) when we have a real game.
