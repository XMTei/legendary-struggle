In an effort to encourage forward progress, development will be divided into a number of phases with self-contained goals.

## Phase 1 - Gameplay Infrastructure 

- Focused on gameplay "engine" with zero UI.
- Unit tests and later maybe a command line "game"
- Goal is 100% of the mechanics (combat, customization) available for the phase 2 arena game
  - Time Slots, Skills, Status Effects, Stats, Scripted AI
- 5% of the content, four hard coded heros, one or two encounters hard coded to swap, just enough to prove things work

## Phase 2 - Arena "Minigame"

- Grow phase 1 into an actual game
- Add an arena style progression, with some unlock metaprogression
- Increase hero selection, skill selection, and overall content
- Still a console application or a bare bones UI

## Phase 3 - Full UI

- Decide on UI tech and move entire game stack to it
- Full animations, graphics, keyboard/mouse/touch events

## Phase 4 - Extended Full Game

- Extend gameplay beyond arena
- Reputation, factions, mission selection
- Hiring mercs, shops
- Move towards full "1.0"
